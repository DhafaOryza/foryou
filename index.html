            Happy 18th birthday! I can't give you expensive presents, but I believe you will like this gift. Thank you for being my Girlfriend! Since I met you in first grade, I never knew anything about you until my friend told us that you were a cosplayer. In second grade I only asked for events on Saturday or Sunday, up until third grade that I finally got you as a couple and now I want to know more about you. That is all I want to say to you. Thank you for reading and I wish you a happy year!
